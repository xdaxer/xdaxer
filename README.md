# 🌊 Hi, I'm Abdullah!

## 🌟 Current Project: X (Twitter) Clone

>I am building a fully functional social media platform that replicates the core features of Twitter using React, modular SCSS, Socket.IO, Express.js, JWT, and SQLite. This project incorporates real-time messaging, user authentication, and database operations, allowing me to apply modern web technologies in practice.
